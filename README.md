## Technologies Used

* jQuery
* HTML
* CSS
* Animate.css
* Jasmine

## Get Started

```
bower install jquery --save
```
```
bower install jasmine --save
```
```
bower install animate.css --save
```
## Implementation

It wasn't too difficult, too easy, matched my level perfectly. 
These two key questions that I had took a while to figure out
-What’s ‘insert’ part?
-What’s ‘average case’ time complexity? 

Best case —> О(n)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Worst case —> O(n2)
[7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Average case —> О(n2) 
[4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 1]
